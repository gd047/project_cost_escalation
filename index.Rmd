## Project  cost growth 

The fraction of the additional project cost, per year of project duration, is given by the following formula:
  $$p = \frac{A}{D \cdot P},$$ 
where <b>A</b> is the <b>additional amount</b> of money that was spent during the <b>total   project duration (D)</b> in years, and <b>P</b> denotes the <b>original budgeted amount</b> (MEURO). 

> - Rearranging the terms we get: $A = p \cdot (D \cdot P).$
